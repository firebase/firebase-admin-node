/**
 * The generated Admin SDK will allow the user to pass in variables, a Data Connect
 * instance, or operation options. The only required argument is the variables,
 * which are only required when the operation has at least one required variable.
 * Otherwise, all arguments are optional. 
 * 
 * This function validates the variables and returns back the DataConnect instance, 
 * variables, and options based on the arguments passed in. It always returns a
 * DataConnect instance, using the connectorConfig to grab one if not provided.
 * 
 * For this function to work properly, if the operation has variables (optional
 * are required), you must pass hasVars: true (if there are no variables, it is
 * not required, since undefined is false-y).
 * 
 * Usage examples can be found in test files.
 * 
 * @param connectorConfig - DataConnect connector config
 * @param dcOrVarsOrOptions - the first argument provided to a generated admin function
 * @param varsOrOptions - the second argument provided to a generated admin function
 * @param options - the third argument provided to a generated admin function
 * @param hasVars - boolean parameter indicating whether the operation has variables
 * @param validateVars - boolean parameter indicating whether we should expect to find a value for realVars
 * @returns parsed DataConnect, Variables, and Options for the operation
