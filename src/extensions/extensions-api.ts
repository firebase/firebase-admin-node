/**
 * `SettableProcessingState` represents all the processing states that can be set
 * on an Extension instance's runtime data.
 * 
 * @remarks
 * You can set the following states:
 * 
 * - `NONE`: No relevant lifecycle event work has been done.
 *   Set this to clear out old statuses.
 * 
 * - `PROCESSING_COMPLETE`: Lifecycle event work completed with no errors.
 * 
 * - `PROCESSING_WARNING`: Lifecycle event work succeeded partially, or
 *   something happened that the user should be warned about.
 * 
 * - `PROCESSING_FAILED`: Lifecycle event work failed completely, but the
 *   instance will still work correctly going forward.
 * 
 * If the extension instance is in a broken state due to errors, instead call
 * {@link Runtime.setFatalError}.
 * 
 * The "processing" state gets set automatically when a lifecycle event handler
 * starts; you can't set it explicitly.
 * To report the ongoing status of an extension's function, use `console.log`
 * or the Cloud Functions logger SDK.
