   * prefixes, for example using a timestamp, causes an increase in latency and error rates in
   * all task commands. The infrastructure relies on an approximately uniform distribution of
   * task IDs to store and serve tasks efficiently.
   *
   * "Push IDs" from the Firebase Realtime Database make poor IDs because they are based on
   * timestamps and will cause contention (slowdowns) in your task queue. Reversed push IDs
